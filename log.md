# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added sponsor.html to GSF revamp. Created a form where users could sign up to sponsor a child in Haiti.

**Thoughts:** : Had to figure out which directory to add the file and which directory was compiled by Gulp. Working from the Views directory NOT the app directory.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through two FCC algorithms: Seek and Destroy, Falsey Bouncer

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
