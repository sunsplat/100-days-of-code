# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added sponsor.html to GSF revamp. Created a form where users could sign up to sponsor a child in Haiti.

**Thoughts:** : Had to figure out which directory to add the file and which directory was compiled by Gulp. Working from the Views directory NOT the app directory.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through two FCC algorithms: Seek and Destroy, Falsey Bouncer

**Thoughts**: Learned how to use the Boolean object and the Arguments object. Had some trouble understanding how to apply filter.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished converting my Twitch.tv app from jQuery to vanilla JS.

**Thoughts** It took longer than I expected to make the AJAX call using XMLHttpRequest. Because I was looping through all the channel names, I couldn't use the same process I did with the Wikipedia API. I created my own AJAX function to handle the request/response. Then I just created a for loop to go through my channel names.  

I also wanted to try out Google's Material Design principles. Still playing around with the color palette and display.

### Day 4: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Digits Multiplication, Absolute Sorting, Median coding challenges on [Checkio](https://js.checkio.org/)

**Thoughts** Learned about the Math.abs() function to work with absolute values. Practiced using the .filter() function with the .map function. Also used .sort(function(a,b){ return a-b}); more than once.

### Day 5: January 30, 2017 Monday  

**Today's Progress**: Spinal Tap Case and Sum All Fibonacci Numbers intermediate algorithm challenges on FCC.  

**Thoughts:** : Learned how to group regex together and assign them to variables using .replace():
  .replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2')

### Day 6: January 31, 2017 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Codewars - Square Every Digit, Thinkful - Number Drills: Congo warehouses, The Office II - Boredom Score  

**Thoughts:** : Math.floor rounds a number down. You can use both Number() and parseInt() to convert a string into an integer.

### Day 7: February 1, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: FCC - Smallest Common Multiple, Finders Keepers

**Thoughts:** : You can pass a whole function in as an argument in Finders Keepers. The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.  

Smallest Common Multiple was a really challenging algorithm that took up most of my morning. I first needed to refresh my memory on what a common multiple was and how to derive it mathematically. Then I needed to figure out how to do it with a range of numbers. I had spent half of my time only focusing on the two numbers given in the parameter. Then I realized the reason my tests weren't passing was because the challenge required the common multiple to apply to a range of numbers. So an important lesson here is to read carefully.

### Day 8: February 2, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: FCC - Steamroller, Good Samaritan Foundation website. Adding MailChimp integration.

**Thoughts:** : Learned about .apply() and how it's similar to .call() but has a more versatile use. You can pass in any number of arguments as an array to .apply() but you have to write each one out for .call().

Having issues with integrating MailChimp form using the code generated for our mailing list in GSF project. Not sure what the issue could be. Still need to troubleshoot.
