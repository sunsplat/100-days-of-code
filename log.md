# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added sponsor.html to GSF revamp. Created a form where users could sign up to sponsor a child in Haiti.

**Thoughts:** : Had to figure out which directory to add the file and which directory was compiled by Gulp. Working from the Views directory NOT the app directory.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through two FCC algorithms: Seek and Destroy, Falsey Bouncer

**Thoughts**: Learned how to use the Boolean object and the Arguments object. Had some trouble understanding how to apply filter.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished converting my Twitch.tv app from jQuery to vanilla JS.

**Thoughts** It took longer than I expected to make the AJAX call using XMLHttpRequest. Because I was looping through all the channel names, I couldn't use the same process I did with the Wikipedia API. I created my own AJAX function to handle the request/response. Then I just created a for loop to go through my channel names.  

I also wanted to try out Google's Material Design principles. Still playing around with the color palette and display.

### Day 4: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Digits Multiplication, Absolute Sorting, Median coding challenges on [Checkio](https://js.checkio.org/)

**Thoughts** Learned about the Math.abs() function to work with absolute values. Practiced using the .filter() function with the .map function. Also used .sort(function(a,b){ return a-b}); more than once.

### Day 1: January 30, 2017 Monday  
  
**Today's Progress**: Spinal Tap Case and Sum All Fibonacci Numbers intermediate algorithm challenges on FCC.  

**Thoughts:** : Learned how to group regex together and assign them to variables using .replace():   .replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2')
