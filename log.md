# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added sponsor.html to GSF revamp. Created a form where users could sign up to sponsor a child in Haiti.

**Thoughts:** : Had to figure out which directory to add the file and which directory was compiled by Gulp. Working from the Views directory NOT the app directory.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through two FCC algorithms: Seek and Destroy, Falsey Bouncer

**Thoughts**: Learned how to use the Boolean object and the Arguments object. Had some trouble understanding how to apply filter.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished converting my Twitch.tv app from jQuery to vanilla JS.

**Thoughts** It took longer than I expected to make the AJAX call using XMLHttpRequest. Because I was looping through all the channel names, I couldn't use the same process I did with the Wikipedia API. I created my own AJAX function to handle the request/response. Then I just created a for loop to go through my channel names.  

I also wanted to try out Google's Material Design principles. Still playing around with the color palette and display.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
